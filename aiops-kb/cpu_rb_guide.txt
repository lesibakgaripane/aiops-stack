When CPU is high on router RB, first check interface utilization and error counters.
Verify BGP sessions and route churn for RB. If RB is acting as a core or PE router,
consider shifting traffic, enabling QoS, or moving noisy customers to another node.
Also review recent config changes and software upgrades that might affect control-plane CPU.
